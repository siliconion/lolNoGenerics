My notes of learning go. 
Really it's so I can sync between machines. Currently following https://tour.golang.org/list

This is created from IntelliJ on my mac. 

To execute Go in IntelliJ, 

* Install go plug-in in IntelliJ
* Install go with `brew install golang`
* Add the following to bash
```
 export GOPATH=$HOME/go-workspace
 export GOROOT=/usr/local/opt/go/libexec
 export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
 export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin
 ```
* Select the correct `GOROOT` in IntelliJ > Preference > Language and Framework > Go > GOROOT
